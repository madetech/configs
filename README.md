# Shared configs

This repos contains a set of configuration files for tools we use. The goal is
to have a common core configuration, in order to facilitate pairing, while
allowing each one to override or add more options to their local machine.

Currently we share configurations for:
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)/[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/)

Each configuration file is commented, giving a brief description of what each
option does.

## Tmux

### Installation

Copy the `tmux.conf` to `~/.tmux.conf`

## Vim/NeoVim

### Installation

Depending on your version, copy `vimrc` to either `~/.vimrc` or
`~/.config/nvim/init.vim`
